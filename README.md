# Sales Insights Project

## About the Project
In this project, I worked on analyzing sales data to understand how different products and regions perform over time. The goal was to clean the data, analyze key metrics, and present the findings in a simple and interactive dashboard.

I used SQL for data analysis and Excel for visualization, focusing on deriving meaningful insights that can help in business decision-making.
